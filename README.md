# python-get-ip-logfile
calculates the frequency that each IP address appears in a log file and displays the results in descending order


expanded explanation :

This script uses a for loop to read each line in the log file, extract the IP address using the split() method, and add it to a list. The script then uses the python collections library to create a Counter object that counts the frequency of each IP address in the list, and assigns the result to a dictionary ip_counts. Finally, the script uses a for loop and the sorted() function to print the IP addresses and their frequencies in descending order.
